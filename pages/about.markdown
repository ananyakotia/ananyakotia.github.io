I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Economics, London School of Economics. <strong>I am on the 2025-26 academic job market</strong>. My research interests are in  trade, finance, and development economics. My research combines micro empirical methods and macroeconomic theory to study the impact of industrial and trade policies on firm dynamics and economic growth in developing countries. 

I am also the Founder and Director of the <strong>India Data Lab Initiative (IDLI)</strong>, an open-source platform that harmonizes over 50 unit-level firm and household surveys from India's Annual Survey of Industries and  National Sample Surveys from 1982 to the present. The initiative aims to promote quantitative historical research by reducing the duplication of  data-cleaning efforts across the research community.

<!-- I visited Dartmouth College as an International Economics Ph.D. Fellow in Fall '23 and visited the Department of Economics, Princeton University in Spring '23.--> 

I have completed an MPhil in economics from the University of Oxford, an MA economics from the University of Cambridge, where I was an Inlaks scholar, and a BA in economics from the University of Delhi.  Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked as a predoctoral research fellow at the Department of Economics, University of Chicago and an Economist at the Ministry of Finance, Government of India.
