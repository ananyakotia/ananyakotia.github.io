I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Economics, London School of Economics. My research interests are in development economics, trade, and finance. My research combines micro empirical methods and macroeconomic theory to study the impact of industrial and trade policies on firm dynamics and economic growth in developing countries. I visited Dartmouth College as an International Economics Ph.D. Fellow in Fall '23 and visited the Department of Economics, Princeton University in Spring '23. I completed an MPhil in economics from the University of Oxford, an MA economics from the University of Cambridge, where I was an Inlaks scholar, and a BA in economics from the University of Delhi.  Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked as a predoctoral research fellow at the Department of Economics, University of Chicago and an Economist at the Ministry of Finance, Government of India.
