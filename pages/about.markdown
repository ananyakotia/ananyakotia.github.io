I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Economics, London School of Economics. <strong>I am on the 2025-26 academic job market</strong>. My research is at the intersection of macro-development, finance, and trade, and uses micro data to study heterogeneity in firm behaviour, and the aggregate implications of this heterogeneity for trade and macro models.

I am also the Founder and Director of the <a href="https://idli.dev" target="_blank">India Data Lab Initiative (IDLI)</a>, an open-source platform that harmonizes over 50 unit-level firm and household surveys from India's Annual Survey of Industries and  National Sample Surveys from 1982 to the present. The initiative aims to promote quantitative historical research by reducing the duplication of  data-cleaning efforts across the research community.


I visited the Department of Economics at Dartmouth College as a <a href="https://globalization.dartmouth.edu/programs/globalization-phd-fellows" target="_blank">Globalization PhD Fellow</a> in Fall 2023 and the Department of Economics at Princeton University in Spring 2023. I have completed an MPhil in economics from the University of Oxford, an MA in economics from the University of Cambridge, where I was an Inlaks Scholar, and a BA in economics from the University of Delhi. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a <a href="https://epic.uchicago.edu/people/ananya-kotia/" target="_blank">Predoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Economics, University of Chicago</a> and as an Economist at the Ministry of Finance, Government of India.
