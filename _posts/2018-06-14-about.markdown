I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Economics, London School of Economics. I am currently visiting Dartmouth College as an International Economics PhD Fellow. My research interests are in macro-development and trade. My research combines micro empirical methods and macroeconomic theory to study the impact of industrial and trade policies on firm dynamics and economic growth in developing countries. I completed an MPhil in economics from the University of Oxford, an MA economics from the University of Cambridge, where I was an Inlaks scholar, and a BA in economics from the University of Delhi.  Prior to starting my Ph.D., I worked as a predoctoral research fellow at the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago and an Economist at the Ministry of Finance, Government of India.
