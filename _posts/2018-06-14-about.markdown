I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Economics, London School of Economics. My research interests are in environmental economics, macro-development, and trade. My research combines micro empirical methods and macroeconomic theory to study the impact of environmental and trade policies on firm dynamics and economic growth in developing countries. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I was a predoctoral research fellow at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago and an Economist at the Ministry of Finance, Government of India.
