I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Economics, London School of Economics. I am interested in combining micro empirical methods and macroeconomic theory to study firm dynamics and economic growth in developing countries. Prior to starting my Ph.D., I was a predoctoral research fellow at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago and an Economist at the Ministry of Finance, Government of India.
